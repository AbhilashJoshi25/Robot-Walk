In this project, I used deep reinforcement learning to train a two-legged robot to walk forward in a virtual environment. 
We’ll first learn how to work with the Gymnasium API (formerly OpenAI Gym), specifically the Walker2d environment, which provides a realistic simulation of a walking robot.

Next, I implemented a policy-gradient algorithm called REINFORCE from scratch using PyTorch and used it to train and test the robot. 
This approach will involve designing a neural network that learns optimal policies through trial and error, gradually improving the agent’s performance based on the rewards received. 
Finally, we’ll plot the learning curve of the algorithm and display the learned policy in the environment.
